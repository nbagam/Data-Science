**Predictive Modeling of Stock Prices Using Time Series Analysis**

**Business Problem**

Accurate prediction of stock prices is crucial for investors, financial analysts, and portfolio managers to make informed decisions. This project aims to apply time series analysis techniques to predict stock prices based on historical data. Stock price data is a classic example of time series data, representing the price movement of a particular stock over time. By analyzing historical stock price data and identifying patterns and trends, we can develop predictive models to forecast future stock prices.

**Research Questions**

How can time series analysis techniques be effectively utilized to predict future stock prices?

What are the key patterns and trends in historical stock price data that influence future price movements?

**Datasets**

The project utilizes historical stock price data sourced from financial databases and stock exchanges. Here are some  sources:

Yahoo Finance

Alpha Vantage API

Quandl

I have used APPL,AMZ,FB data for prediction, check the dataset folde for source files.

**Features Used for Forecasting:**

date: Date of the stock price record

open: Opening price of the stock

high: Highest price of the stock during the trading session

low: Lowest price of the stock during the trading session

close: Closing price of the stock

volume: Number of shares traded

**Methods**

The project employs various time series analysis techniques, including:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): For modeling the time series data and making forecasts based on the identified patterns.

SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): To account for seasonality in the stock prices.

Prophet: A forecasting tool developed by Facebook, suitable for time series with daily observations that exhibit strong seasonal effects.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for learning and predicting sequences in time series data.

Model selection and hyperparameter tuning are conducted to optimize the accuracy and reliability of predictions.

**Ethical Considerations**

Ensuring transparency in the modeling process to build trust with stakeholders and users.

Addressing potential biases in the models to ensure fair and unbiased predictions across different stocks.

Providing clear communication about the limitations and uncertainties of the predictive models to prevent misuse.

**Challenges/Issues**

Incorporating external factors such as market news, economic indicators, and geopolitical events that may affect stock prices.

Dealing with high volatility and noise in the stock price data.

Ensuring the models can generalize well to different stocks and market conditions.
