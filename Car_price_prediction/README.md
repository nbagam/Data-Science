Title: Used Car Sale Price Prediction with Random Forest

**Overview:**

This project focuses on predicting the sale price of used cars using the Random Forest algorithm. Accurately predicting the sale price of a used car can provide significant value to both buyers and sellers in the automotive market. By leveraging historical data on various car features such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition, this project aims to train a Random Forest model to predict a reasonable price for a used car.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains attributes of used cars, including make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, engine size, and more. The target variable is the sale price of the cars. The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features before training the Random Forest model.

**Methodology**
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features if necessary. 

Model Training: Utilize the Random Forest algorithm to train the predictive model on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the Random Forest model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model to optimize its performance.

Prediction: Deploy the trained Random Forest model to predict the sale price of new instances (used cars).

**Result:**

The final Random Forest model demonstrates satisfactory accuracy in predicting the sale price of used cars. It provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the pricing of used cars, aiding both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

**Future Work**

Explore feature importance analysis to understand the significant factors affecting the sale price of used cars. 
Conduct further experiments with different variations of the Random Forest algorithm to enhance predictive performance. 
Develop a user-friendly interface for easy deployment and usage of the trained Random Forest model. 

**Usage**

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/nbag/used-car-price-prediction.git]

Run the notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions.
