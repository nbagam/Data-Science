**Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data for Brand Perception Analysis**

**Business Problem**

Understanding public sentiment toward a brand, product, or topic is crucial for businesses to gauge market perception and make informed decisions. This project aims to analyze sentiments expressed on Twitter to gain insights into public perceptions and sentiments. Twitter is a rich real-time data source where users share their opinions, feedback, and experiences, making it an ideal platform for sentiment analysis.

**Research Questions**

How can sentiment analysis be effectively utilized to understand public perceptions and sentiments toward a brand on Twitter?

What are the key factors influencing the sentiments expressed in tweets about a brand, product, or topic?

**Datasets**

The project utilizes Twitter data, collected using the Twitter API. Here are some potential sources and methods for data collection:

Twitter API
Tweepy Library for Python-based data collection

Please check the dataset folder for the source files for data.

**Features Used for Analysis:**

tweet_id: Unique identifier for the tweet

user_id: Unique identifier for the user

timestamp: Time when the tweet was posted

text: Content of the tweet

retweet_count: Number of retweets

favorite_count: Number of likes

user_followers_count: Number of followers the user has

**Methods**

The project employs various sentiment analysis techniques, including:

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning the tweet text by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.

Sentiment Classification: Using machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning models like LSTM and BERT to classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

Lexicon-Based Approaches: Utilizing predefined sentiment lexicons such as VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for sentiment scoring.

Model selection and hyperparameter tuning are conducted to optimize the accuracy and reliability of sentiment classification.

**Ethical Considerations**
Ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of users whose tweets are analyzed.

Avoiding biases in the sentiment analysis models to ensure fair and accurate sentiment classification across different user demographics.

Providing transparency in the analysis process to build trust with stakeholders and the public.

**Challenges/Issues**

Dealing with the unstructured nature of tweet text, which may include slang, abbreviations, and emojis.

Handling sarcasm and irony in tweets, which can affect sentiment classification accuracy.

Ensuring the models can generalize well to different brands, products, and topics.
