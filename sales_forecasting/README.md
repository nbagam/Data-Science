Features Used for Forecasting:

date: Date of the sales record                                                                                                                                       
product_id: Unique identifier for the furniture product                                                                                                              
sales_quantity: Number of units sold                                                                                                                                 
price: Price of the furniture item at the time of sale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
**Methods:-**
The project employs various time series forecasting models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet, to predict future furniture sales. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning techniques are utilized to optimize forecast accuracy.                                                                                           

**Ethical Considerations:-**
Ensuring the privacy and security of customer data used for forecasting purposes.
Providing transparent insights into the forecasting process to stakeholders to build trust and credibility.
Mitigating biases in the forecasting models to ensure fair and unbiased predictions.                                                                                  
**Challenges/Issues:-**
Incorporating external factors such as economic trends, seasonality, and marketing campaigns into the forecasting models.
Dealing with outliers and anomalies in the sales data that may affect forecast accuracy.
Evaluating model performance and ensuring the robustness of forecasts across different time periods and product categories.
